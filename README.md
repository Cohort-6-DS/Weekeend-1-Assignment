In this problem you have data for the istanbul stock exchange as your target and 8 other stock exchanges as predictors.Use ISE as your target(there are two ise columns , one is in lira the other in dollars, choose USB based)

This can either be run as a linear regression or a classification problem. In classification, the target neess to be mapped to price goes down (-1) or price goes up (1). You sre free to choose either but on Monday you must be able to justify why either option is better.
